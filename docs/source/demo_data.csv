1,"PROCEDURE:  CT CHEST WO CONTRAST. HISTORY:  Wheezing TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast helical thoracic CT was performed. COMPARISON:  There is no prior chest CT for comparison. FINDINGS:   Support Devices:  None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels:        Cardiac size is normal.      There is no calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis.       There is no pericardial effusion.      The aorta is normal in diameter.      The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter. Pleural Spaces:  Few small pleural calcifications are present in the right pleura for example on 2/62 and 3/76.  The pleural spaces are otherwise clear. Mediastinum/Hila:  There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement.  Subcentimeter minimally calcified paratracheal lymph nodes are likely related to prior granulomas infection. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen:  There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement.  Limited, non-contrast imaging through the upper abdomen is within normal limits.  Mild degenerative change is present in the spine. Lungs/Central Airways: There is a 15 mm nodular density in the nondependent aspect of the bronchus intermedius on 2/52.  The trachea and central airways are otherwise clear.  There is mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening.  There is a calcified granuloma in the posterior right upper lobe.  The lungs are otherwise clear. CONCLUSIONS:   1.  There is mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening suggesting small airways disease such as asthma or bronchitis in the appropriate clinical setting. 2.  A 3 mm nodular soft tissue attenuation in the nondependent aspect of the right bronchus intermedius is nonspecific, which could be mucus or abnormal soft tissue.  A follow-up CT in 6 months might be considered to evaluate the growth. 3.  Stigmata of old granulomatous disease is present. &#x20; FINAL REPORT Attending Radiologist:",Lung Findings,CT Chest,"A 3 mm nodular soft tissue attenuation in the nondependent aspect of the right bronchus intermedius is nonspecific, which could be mucus or abnormal soft tissue.  A follow-up CT in 6 months might be considered to evaluate the growth."

COMPARISON:  CT chest, CT chest abdomen pelvis. FINDINGS CT CHEST:   Support Devices:  None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels:        Cardiac size is normal.      Calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis cannot be evaluated on this exam.      There is no pericardial effusion.      There is no significant calcific aortic and branch vessel atherosclerosis.      The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter. Pleural Spaces:  The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila:  There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm:  There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement.   Mild degenerative change is present in the spine.

There are postsurgical changes of right lower lobe segmentectomy.  There is stable focus of probable nodular scarring (3/52).  There is a curvilinear band of volume loss of the posterior right middle lobe, similar to prior.  There are stable pulmonary micronodules in the left upper lobe (3/42) and left lower lobe (3/72). The left lower lobe nodule is likely calcified.  FINDINGS CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Liver: The liver is normal in size.  There is a stable 0.9 cm low-density focus in the right hepatic lobe near the junction of segments 6 and 7 (2/51).  An additional punctate low-density focus in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is too small to characterize but stable in size (2/48). Biliary tree: The patient is post cholecystectomy.

An explanation for the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms is not identified on this examination. Specifically, no bowel obstruction or bowel wall thickening or inflammatory changes seen. 2.  Multifocal groundglass opacities and consolidation in the lung bases, consistent with the patient's history of COVID pneumonia. 3.
